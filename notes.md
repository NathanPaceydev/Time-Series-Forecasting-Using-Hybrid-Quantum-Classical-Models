# ðŸ“ˆ Project Plan: Hybrid Quantum-Classical Time Series Forecasting

## Project Title
Time Series Forecasting Using Hybrid Quantum-Classical Models on Stock Market Data

## Objective
Develop and compare classical and hybrid quantum-classical models for time series forecasting using financial stock or options data. The aim is to explore the performance benefits of incorporating quantum circuits into standard ML forecasting pipelines.

---

## 1. Data Strategy

- **Data Source**: Use readily accessible or pre-existing datasets of company stock prices or stock options data.
- **Approach**:
  - Identify a suitable dataset (e.g., via Yahoo Finance, Kaggle, Quandl, or other public repositories).
  - Ensure the dataset includes time-indexed pricing data (e.g., open, close, volume).

## 2. Development Workflow

### 2.1 Phase 1: Classical Model Development

- **Initial Models**:
  - Start with RNN, LSTM, or GRU architectures
  - Leverage prior thesis work to guide model design and hyperparameter selection
- **Preprocessing**:
  - Normalize or scale time series data
  - Apply windowing techniques to prepare sequences
- **Training**:
  - Train classical models on historical stock data
  - Use standard forecasting metrics for evaluation (MAE, RMSE, etc.)

### 2.2 Phase 2: Hybrid Quantum-Classical Model

- **Integration**:
  - Add a quantum circuit layer (e.g., variational quantum circuit) to the classical model
  - Be open to restructuring parts of the classical model to better integrate the quantum component
- **Quantum Layer Design**:
  - Test different quantum circuit depths and architectures
  - Explore feature encoding strategies suitable for financial data
- **Optimization**:
  - Tune both classical and quantum hyperparameters for best hybrid performance

---

## 3. Evaluation and Comparison

- Train and evaluate both classical and hybrid models using consistent metrics
- Compare results graphically and numerically
- Record performance impacts introduced by the quantum layer
- Document observations and areas of improvement

---

## 4. Deliverables

- **Jupyter Notebook**: Complete implementation, including data preprocessing, models, training loops, and results
- **Report (1â€“2 Pages)**: Summary of methodology, findings, model decisions, and reflections on quantum contributions
- **Presentation (5â€“7 Minutes)**: Overview of work, challenges, and personal background

---

## Notes

- Parameter tuning and model architecture may evolve based on quantum integration needs
- Maintain flexibility in model design to experiment with novel ideas during development

First get working hybrid
Then compare to my thesis 
maybe add more data 
build classic ML
compare hyper parameter's and setup to thesis
iterate

Issues encountered
- data normalization / window on stock options is a complex issue
- ![alt text](image.png)
    The quantum circuit was making predictions in a very tight band, indicating the quantum layer isn't learning meaningful transformations

    lstm.weight_ih_l0 grad mean: 0.000000
lstm.weight_hh_l0 grad mean: 0.000000
Component	Behavior
quantum_out	Always [0.9999272, 0.99993163] â€” totally static
final output	Only slightly changes (depends on linear2)
gradients	All zero in lstm and linear1 layers
only linear2	Receives gradient and updates (after quantum layer)
ðŸ§  What this tells us:
The quantum layer is completely ignoring its inputs
