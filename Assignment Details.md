# Time Series Forecasting Using Hybrid Quantum-Classical Models
Assignment for Terra Quantum - Interview Assignment -
Work by Nathan Pacey

## Assignment Description

Develop a time series forecasting model using a combination of classical machine learning models and quantum circuits. You have full freedom to choose any classical model (e.g., RNN, LSTM, Transformer, or ARIMA) and any quantum circuit architecture (e.g., variational quantum circuits).

You are tasked with building a hybrid quantum-classical model for time series forecasting. The model should combine a classical machine learning approach with a quantum circuit to enhance its predictive performance. The task aims to explore how quantum circuits can improve feature extraction, temporal pattern recognition, or sequence encoding when combined with classical models.

## 1. Coding Assignment

### 1.1 Data

- Choose a real-world or synthetic time series dataset (e.g., weather, financial, or sensor data).
- Perform preprocessing steps such as normalization, scaling, and windowing to create training and test sets.

### 1.2 Model

- Create a hybrid quantum neural network.

### 1.3 Training & Evaluation

- Train the hybrid model and a comparable classical baseline on the dataset.
- Evaluate the models using standard time series forecasting metrics.

### 1.4 Comparison

- Compare the hybrid quantum-classical model’s performance with the classical baseline.
- Experiment with different quantum circuit architectures, depths, and feature encoding strategies.

## 2. Report

You are expected to submit:

### 2.1 Jupyter Notebook

- Data preparation and preprocessing steps
- Model implementation with detailed comments
- Graphical evaluation of results (e.g., forecasts, metrics, and comparisons)

### 2.2 Short Report (1–2 Pages)

- Summary of selected models and quantum circuits
- Key insights
- Challenges faced
- Possible improvements
- Whether the quantum circuit contributed to performance improvements

## 3. Presentation

In your presentation, include:

- Who you are
- What you do
- What your interests are
- Whether you already have done research or have working experience

This part should be covered in **max. 5 minutes**. The goal is simply to understand who is presenting.

## Additional Note

In terms of depth, it's best to look for a solution in the middle. Don’t spend too much time on the details, but rather share your **approach and ideas** for handling the task.
